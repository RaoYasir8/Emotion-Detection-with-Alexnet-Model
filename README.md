# Emotion-Detection-using-Alexnet-Model
This project implements an Emotion Detection system using the AlexNet deep learning architecture for facial expression classification.
The model is trained to recognize multiple human emotions from images using convolutional neural networks and optimized preprocessing techniques.
It demonstrates the practical application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning in real-world emotion recognition systems.
